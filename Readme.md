As part of the advanced embedded systems course, we built a small delivery robot for the delivery of packages/letters in an open office space that we called MailBot 
MailBot is supposed to move to superior or inferior desk numbers while following a black line on the floor. The responsive website allows controlling and sending it to the desk number introduced in the input field. A load cell is supposed to weigh the delivery and check whether it exceeds the 1kg limit or not. The states of the robot are displayed on an OLED screen and on the website.

This repository include only the ESP32 software.
